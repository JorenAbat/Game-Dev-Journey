      <h2>Welcome to My Game Development Journey</h2>
      <p>
        Hi, I'm Joren! This website is my personal space where I share my
        experiences, projects, and experiments in game development. I'm just a
        hobbyist who enjoys creating and exploring the world of game design.
        Everything you'll find here is a product of my curiosity and passion
        for learning. I hope you find my projects interesting and maybe even
        get inspired to try game development yourself. Let's enjoy the journey
        together!

      <h2>My (brief) History with Game Development</h2>
      <p>
        Below is a condensed timeline of key milestones in my journey as a
        game developer:

      <table class="table">
        <thead>
          <tr>
            <th>Year</th>
            <th>Milestone</th>
            <th>Description</th>

            <td>Played my first video game</td>
            <td>
              Some people may say their game development journey started with
              the first time they learned how to code but I believe it starts
              with the first game that hooked you so much that you wanted to
              create games yourself.
              <br><br>
              The first game I ever played was Pokemon Sapphire for the Game
              Boy Advance because my neighbors had the game.

            <td>2012</td>
            <td>Learned my first Programming Language (Java)</td>
            <td>
              Around this time, I was first entering high school and I wanted
              to be a game developer. I asked my mom if I could enroll in an
              class to learn Java since I knew that Minecraft was coded in
              Java. <br><br>
              I completed 2 certificates of Intro to Java
            </td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td>2013-2016</td>
            <td>Learned various game engines</td>
            <td>
              Throughout my time in High-School, I played around with numerous
              game engines and tried making a bunch of small games from
              platformers rhythm games, collectathons, etc.
              <br>Unity, Game Maker, RPG Maker to name a few. <br><br>
              They all were single level concepts made for me to learn how to
              create certain mechanics in different game engines and less of a
              full fledged game.
            </td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td>2019</td>
            <td>First Completed Game with a team</td>
            <td>
              In University, I took a course on game development and with a
              team of 4, I made a platformer game using the game engine
              Construct-2. I was responsbile for the coding aspect of the game
              while my peers worked on the music, the art and other aspects.

        My Favourite game series are Pokemon, Mario and Sonic. This led me to
        learn how to make RPG, Collect-a-thon and Platformer games which lines
        up with each game series.
