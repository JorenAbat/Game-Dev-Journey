      <p>
        Below is a showcase of my game development projects, highlighting my
        journey in creating games that I'm proud of. Each project represents a
        milestone in my growth as a developer.

        <h3>Johnny Smoke</h3>
        <p>
          "Johnny Smoke" is a 2D sidescrolling platformer where the player
          controls Johnny Smoke as he explores a desert in search of Iron
          Lung, shooting Lungs that get in the way. <br><br>
          This game was a collaborative project between four classmates for a
          Game Design class. My main responsibility was bringing all the art
          assets and creative elements together using Construct 2, the engine
          we used for development.

        <h3>Novum</h3>
        <p>
          "Novum" is a 3D collectathon platformer set in a post-apocalyptic
          city after a deadly epidemic. As supplies run low, you must venture
          from an underground shelter to scavenge for resources.
          <br><br>
          This game was a team effort between my classmate and myself. I
          handled coding and asset integration, while they created the models
          and graphics. We used Unity and Blender for the project.

        <h3>Fantasy Bullet Heck</h3>
        <p>
          Fantasy Bullet Heck is a 2D bullet-hell video game where you use
          your hand with an Xbox Kinect to control a character on screen to
          dodge bullets shot at you by fantasy creatures.
          <br><br>
          The game was made using Processing, a programming language based off
          Java that is mainly used for electronic art.
