      <h2>What Inspires Me in Game Development</h2>
      <p>

        inspirations that continue to fuel my passion.

        <h3>My Love For Video Games</h3>
        <p>
          First and foremost, my biggest inspiration would simply be my love
          for video games.
          <br><br>
          <b>Why it Inspires Me:</b> Video games have always been a huge part
          of my life. They’ve been a way to have fun, escape, and dive into
          different worlds. Through gaming, I’ve connected with people who
          share the same passion, and some of my closest friendships started
          because of a shared love for video games. <br><br>I want to be a
          game developer to create experiences that capture the joy, wonder,
          and connection I felt growing up with games. Making worlds that
          inspire others and bring them the same excitement and memories I
          cherished.

        <h3>Pokemon Series (Video Games)</h3>
        <p>
          <b>Why it Inspires Me:</b> The Pokémon games have been a huge
          inspiration for me in game development, especially since they're the
          first games I played. <br><br>I love how they combine
          exploration, strategy, and storytelling into a world that feels both
          vast and personal. The way Pokémon encourages players to discover,
          collect, and connect with the game world pushes me to create
          projects that are fun and engaging. <br><br>It’s the blend of
          simplicity and depth in Pokémon that motivates me to build games
          that spark curiosity and offer a sense of adventure.

          game developer and twitch streamer who is known for creating the
          game Heartbound. <br><br>Throughout his streams and online
          content, he always advocates for people to make games and helps them
          by providing resources, support and a platform for indie game
          developers to showcase and foster their skills. <br><br>His

        <h3>Indie Games Scene</h3>
        <p>
          <b>Why it Inspires Me:</b> The indie games scene has shown that
          small teams can create meaningful and innovative experiences. Titles
          like <b> Celeste </b> and <b>Hades</b> demonstrate the power of
          passion-driven projects and it's very inspiring to see smaller indie
          companies create such an impact.
